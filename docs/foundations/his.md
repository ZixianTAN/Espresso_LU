# Historical Development of DFT

> The modern DFT is based on the Kohn–Sham equations. Before that, several key concepts were developed which established the foundation of the modern theory. This section briefly introduces them to help understanding DFT.

## Many-body Schrödinger Equation

From some textbooks introducing quantum mechanics, the behaviour of all particles can be described by their wavefunction $\psi(\vec{\mathbf{r}})$ for every point in space:

$$
\vec{\mathbf{r}}= x\mathbf{u}_x + y\mathbf{u}_y + z\mathbf{u}_z
$$

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(\vec{\mathbf{r}}, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{\mathcal{H}} \Psi(\vec{\mathbf{r}}, t)
$$

A more general representation for the coordinate vector is:

$$
\vec{\mathbf{r}} = (r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n)
$$
