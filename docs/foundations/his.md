# Historical Development of DFT

> The Modern DFT is based on Kohn-Sham equations. Before it, there are some basic concepts establish the modern thoery. This section will cover them, hope it may helpful for understanding the DFT.

## Many-body Schr&ouml;dinger Equation

From some text books introduce the quantum mechanics, all particles' behaviour can be described by their wavefunction $\psi(\vec{\mathbf{r}})$ for every point $\vec{\mathbf{r}}=x\mathbf{u}_x+y\mathbf{u}_y+z\mathbf{u}_z$
$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t)}{\partial t}
= \hat{\mathcal{H}} \Psi(\vec{\mathbf{r}},t) 
$$

$$
\vec{\mathbf{r}} = (r_1,r_2,\dots, r_n)
$$



## Thomas-Fermi method
