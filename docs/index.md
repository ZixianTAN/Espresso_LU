## 🎯 About This Site

This site provides notes and tutorials on **first-principles electronic-structure calculations** using **Quantum ESPRESSO**.
It is based on my personal experience learning **First-Principles** and **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations with Quantum ESPRESSO.

I am still learning and by no means an expert, so there may be some inaccuracies. If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/ZixianTAN/Espresso_LU/issues) - your feedback is greatly appreciated.

The materials are primarily intended for **postgraduate students and researchers in computational chemistry** at **Lancaster University**, aiming to promote effective learning, reproducibility, and best practices in **High End Computing (HEC) Cluster** environments.
